## Currently have
- Laptop: Asus TUF, 7 6800H. Build like shit, not dogshit though. The keyboard is dogshit though. For spec, it is nice, till i realized i got it for 1 year too soon. All is meaningless when I flash Linux on this though. For workflow, it is quite nice for the multifunction numpad. All heavy load word and leisure time, it can deliver, not gracefully.
- Phone: I broke a few. Lost a few (Samsung S9). My A90 5G got the screen borked. I have a A51 for backup, which makes my daily is Oppo A53
- Thinkpad R400: A boomer possessed me (Luke Smith). It is a backup for me, and to test the transfer protocol. Or just fit the vibes of a Doomer
## Want to have
- Must have backup of important datas like documents, and such
    -> Supports micro SD slot or I can use Terminus/Syncthing to pass daa through phone and laaptp
    - The camera must not be dogshit. Ala try to beat the A90 ̀5G in that department
- Phone: Only first impression and evaluation
  + Oneplus 9 Pro: can get for 5.5 mil VND at time of writing this (2024). I didn't buy this for the Hassleblad camera  setup. Spec is nice (no need totl), looks great, screen and battery is moderate.
  + Pixel 7/7 Pro: Insane software support. Might have problem with dongle DACs (Dawn Pro). Most importantly, CAN FLASH LINEAGE OS (https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/)
  + Samung S21 Plus <-> S22 Ultra: Just works out of the box. Feels really nice in hand. Now I start to understand why people just aim for this solely (not why they flip this line of flagship annually though). And please remove the bloatware.
  + Redmi Note 12 Turbo: Don't let the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 turns you down. (I heard that it is good for a cheap gaming phone)
  + LG 60 (thinq?: Snapdragon 865, ̉6,7 inch, 2.5 mil -> 4 mil dong. Mainly buy for quad dac
